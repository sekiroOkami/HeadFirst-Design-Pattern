We want to vary a small paet of an algorithm while keeping the rest of the algorithm the same.

but...
Language design is program design, language influence our design , we cannot design in isolation of the languages
When a language restricts what we can do we end up a bit powerless.

Design patterns often kick in to fill the gaps with a programing language.
in the other word, if we celebrate design pattern a lot more that's not a good sign.

A more power a language is, the less we talk about design patterns as these naturally become the features of the
language.

in the pass, how did we use strategy
We create an interface and then a bunch of classes. Then wire them together often use factories.

Lambdas are lightweight strategies, it can help us to design the code a lot more effectively

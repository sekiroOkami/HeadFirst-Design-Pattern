1.No Side-Effects: The pipeline doesn't modify any external state. It operates only on the inputs provided and produces
new values or collections without affecting variables or data outside its scope.

2. Deterministic: The pipeline always returns the same result when given the same input. It doesn't rely on external
state that can change between calls, like mutable variables, system time, or random numbers.
